India’s core inflation edged higher in February: Report,"Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.
NEW DELHI: India’s core inflation outlook remains positive despite rising industrial metal prices, a report by ICICI Bank Global Markets revealed.Core inflation remained higher in February, majorly due to a surge in gold prices.
While vegetable prices could rise during the summer, the high base effect from last year should prevent a sharp increase in overall food inflation.The expected rise in rabi crop output, particularly wheat and cereals, should also help stabilise food prices.
However, edible oils and sugar prices may see some upward pressure due to global market trends and a dip in sugarcane production.Despite the rise in industrial metal prices, a stable Indian rupee and weak global energy demand are likely to keep core inflation contained.
Latest data now pegs Q4 FY25 inflation at 3.9 per cent, giving the central bank room to ease its policy stance.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-core-inflation-edged-higher-in-february-report/articleshow/118966225.cms,,Unknown
