Adani top bidder for Rs 36k crore redevelopment project in Goregaon,"Gautam Adani's group is the highest bidder for Mumbai's Rs 36,000 crore Motilal Nagar redevelopment project, offering more built-up area than its nearest rival, L&TMUMBAI: After the Dharavi slum redevelopment project, billionaire Gautam Adani's group has emerged as the highest bidder for the Rs 36,000 crore redevelopment project at Motilal Nagar in Mumbai, said sources.Motilal Nagar I, II & III is one of Mumbai's biggest housing redevelopment projects, covering 143 acres in the western suburb of Goregaon (West).Adani Properties Pvt Ltd (APPL) emerged as the highest bidder, offering more built-up area than its nearest rival, L&T, said sources.The letter of allotment (LoA) will be issued in due course.This will be the second mega redevelopment project of Adani Group in Mumbai.
It is already redeveloping Dharavi, one of Asia's largest slums in Mumbai.Adani Group did not offer any comments on the matter.The Bombay high court last week gave the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority ( MHADA ) the go-ahead to redevelop Motilal Nagar through a construction and development agency (C&DA).The state govt has declared it as a ‘special project', with MHADA retaining control over it but working through a C&DA in absence of the necessary potential to accomplish the work, based on economic viability and its capability.
The total estimated redevelopment cost of Motilal Nagar is around Rs 36,000 crore, and the rehabilitation period is seven years from the project start/commencement date.As per tender conditions for Motilal Nagar redevelopment , C&DA must give a housing stock of 3.83 lakh square metres.APPL won the bid by agreeing to hand over 3.97 lakh sq mt to MHADA.
The other qualified bidder, L&T quoted the figure of 2.6 lakh sq mt.MHADA retains full control over the project, including ownership of the land.
It tendered for the redevelopment due to its own financial and technical limitations in handling such a large-scale redevelopment.Sources said the project aims to eliminate illegal construction and create a planned, well-integrated community in a holistic manner.The private developer cannot mortgage the land, raise finance on it, or sell/transfer rights without MHADA's permission, according to the tender conditions.This protects MHADA residents and slum-dwellers, and prevents misuse of redevelopment rights.The selected C&DA will be responsible for the entire redevelopment process, including design, approvals, construction, infrastructure development and rehabilitation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/adani-highest-bidder-for-rs-36000-crore-motilal-nagar-redevelopment/articleshow/118901780.cms,,Unknown,Positive,0.08
